# AdventureWorks-Project
On this Priject, I used data from Microsfot called "AdventureWorks sample databases". It´s a well know platform to practice your skills.
I learned to use MS SQL, but I realize the sintaxis was not that different from MySql that I have been using in the past.
I simulated a situation in where my manager request data from me, put it down on a document and then started playing with the database to provide valuable insights.
All of this was then deployed on a Power BI visualization of 3 pages where we can identity the situation in different scenarios.
The visualization is complete, but also easy to catch on, without difficult graphs or complicated Kpi´s. The main goal is that he manager understand and can be used later on by another colleagues.
In this repository, you will find the SQL script (with an update from a third pary, so the data can be usable), the csv files and the Power BI file too.
